<p>I pretty much just followed the instructions on the media wiki website. Only difference was I used this in my <code>.htaccess</code>:</p>
<pre>RewriteRule ^wiki/(.*) /mediawiki/index.php?title=$1 [PT,L,QSA]</pre>
<p>I think this was also from the mediawiki website somewhere. Initially I put <code>/wiki</code> copying their alias command, but that was wrong.</p>
