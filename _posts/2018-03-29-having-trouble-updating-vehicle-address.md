After moving, I tried to file my [change of address][1] information
online and for my license, it went fine without any issue. However,
when trying to submit my vehicle change of address, there was an
error.

I was really confused because I don't know what possibly could have
been different. I suspected at first maybe I misspelled the VIN or my
name (wouldn't have been the first time), but no, I was pretty
confident I typed it all out correctly. I doubled checked everything
against my registration card and the example registration card they
provided.

Pretty much, at this point, I was ready to give up. Searching my error
on Google lead to finding a lot of people posting this on the CA DMV's
Facebook page. There was a hint about searching your vehicle
registration for some mysterious "RCID" field (which probably stands
for "Registration Card Issue Date").

After finding the link to [request vehicle registration][2] online,
requesting it only cost <span>$</span>2.  I thought I would give this a try---maybe
there really was a typo or who knows. So I'll just pay the <span>$</span>2 and see
what happens.

In the section that showed my recent registration information, there
was a date close to but not the same as my registration card's "Date
Issued" date, it was just a few days earlier under "RCID". Using this
date, I was able to complete my vehicle change of address.
