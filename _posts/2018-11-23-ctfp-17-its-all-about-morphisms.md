1. Consider some degenerate cases of a naturality condition and draw the 
   appropriate diagrams. For instance, what happens if either functor $F$ or
   $G$ map both objects $a$ and $b$ (the ends of $f:a \to b$) to the same
   object, e.g., $Fa = Fb$ or $Ga = Gb$? (Notice that you get a cone or a 
   co-cone this way.) Then consider cases where either $Fa = Ga$ or $Fb = Gb$.
   Finally, what if you start with a morphism that loops on itself â€” $f:a \to a$.
