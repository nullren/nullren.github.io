I am trying something I have seen on many blogs around the internet: I
will work through all the exercises in Munkres' textbook, *Topology*. I
have never tried anything like this before and it will definitely test
my ability to stay motivated as I tend to get bored easily. So, without
further ado, I present the exercises of *Topology*, Chapter 1, "Set
Theory and Logic", Section 1, "Fundamental Concepts".

1. Check the distributive laws for $\cup$ and $\cap$ and DeMorgan's
laws.

This amounts to showing the following are true:
* $A \cap ( B \cup C ) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
* $A \cup ( B \cap C ) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
* $A - (B \cup C) = (A - B) \cap (A - C)$
* $A - (B \cap C) = (A - B) \cup (A - C)$
