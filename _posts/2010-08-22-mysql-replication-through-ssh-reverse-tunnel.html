well, connecting to a mysql db through a reverse tunnel was easy.

on the host machine (in this case, my ircbot's vm) do something like:
<pre>$ ssh -nNT -R 3307:localhost:3306 remote@machine</pre>

now on the remote machine, i can test it is working by logging into mysql at that port:
<pre>$ mysql -h localhost -P 3307 -u root -p</pre>
all is well&mdash;<em>or so i thought</em>.

after configuring mysql to be a replication master in typical fashion, i enabled binlogs, set the binlog databases and gave it a server-id. something like this was added to the <code>mysqld</code> section of my <code>my.cnf</code>:
<pre>log-bin

binlog-do-db = awesome
binlog-do-db = awesomest

binlog-ignore-db = mysql
binlog-ignore-db = test

server-id   = 1</pre>
gave <code>mysqld</code> a restart.

then i added a replication user - note the <code>@'%'</code>
<pre>mysql> grant replication slave on *.* to 'repuser'@'%' identified by 'awesomepassword';</pre>

last thing to do was just make a dump of my databases. since they're small, i can do this.
<pre>$ mysqldump --databases --add-drop-database awesome awesomest &gt;awesome_dump.sql</pre>

i copied <code>awesome_dump.sql</code> to the slave machine. i shut down <code>mysqld</code> first and changed the <code>server-id</code> in the <code>my.cnf</code>
<pre>server-id   = 2</pre>
then i started up mysql and dumped the databases into it
<pre>$ sudo /etc/rc.d/mysqld start
$ mysql -uroot -p &lt;awesome_dump.sql</pre>

then i had to actually start replication in <code>mysql</code>
<pre>mysql&gt; change master to 
    -&gt; MASTER_HOST='localhost', 
    -&gt; MASTER_PORT=3307, 
    -&gt; MASTER_USER='repuser', 
    -&gt; MASTER_PASSWORD='awesomepassword', 
    -&gt; MASTER_LOG_FILE='ircbot-bin.000002', 
    -&gt; MASTER_LOG_POS=106;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
mysql&gt; slave start;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)</pre>

then i check <code>show slave status</code> to make sure everything was okay
<pre>error connecting to master 'repuser@localhost:3307'</pre>
fml.

when i first set this up, i created my replication user as <code>'repuser'@'%'</code>. normally that is fine, but in the default installation of mysql on arch linux, there are anonymous users. so logging in as <code>'repuser'@'<b>localhost</b>'</code>, it actually logged me in as <code>''@'localhost'</code> instead of <code>'repl'</code>. joy. 

there are two ways to fix this:<ul>
<li>create the user <code>'repuser'@'localhost'</code></li>
<li>remove anonymous users</li>
</ul>

i did both. all is well again in the land of nool.
