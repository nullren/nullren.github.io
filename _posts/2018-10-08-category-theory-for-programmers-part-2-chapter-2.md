Challenges

1. How would you describe a pushout in the category of C++ classes?

2. Show that the limit of the identity functor Id :: C -> C is the
   initial object.

3. Subsets of a given set form a category. A morphism in that
   category is defined to be an arrow connecting two sets if the
   first is the subset of the second. What is a pullback of two
   sets in such a category? Whatâ€™s a pushout? What are the initial
   and terminal objects?

4. Can you guess what a coequalizer is?

5. Show that, in a category with a terminal object, a pullback
   towards the terminal object is a product.

6. Similarly, show that a pushout from an initial object (if one
   exists) is the coproduct.
