From last lecture, we know topological manifolds are Hausdorff,
second-countable, and locally euclidean, or $\forall x \in M$, $\exists
U = N(x)$ such that $\phi \: U \to \tilde{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a
homeomorphism.

### Smooth Manifolds

If we have an $n$-dimensional topological manifold, $X$, when is $f\: X
\to \mathbb{R}^n$ smooth?
