This is just a plac-holder/note.

Going to have a look at swapping apache for nginx. As well as swapping
tomcat for jetty.

There are a few things I have yet to inspect.

Also, looking into this will have the benefit of looking into HTTPS
everywhere although I suspect the difficulty in implementing that is
primarily due to website functionality because to turn on SSL is
trivial.
