when i was much younger, i used winamp at one time to play my mp3s.
one of the themes that i used that i used to really enjoy and still
find a little endearing is *Act2 Finale* (which can [be found
here](http://www.winamp.com/skin/act2-finale-v5/145506)).

here are just a couple files taken for that page so that i always have
a copy.
