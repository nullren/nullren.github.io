there is probably a better way to do this, but i messed up the init.d script for tomcat. to restore it i unpacked the deb and copied the fresh file over the broken one. tada.
<pre># cp /var/cache/apt/archives/tomcat5.5_5.5.26-5_all.deb .
# mkdir derp
# dpkg -x tomcat5.5_5.5.26-5_all.deb ./derp/
# cd derp
# ls
etc  usr  var
# cp etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 /etc/init.d/</pre>
