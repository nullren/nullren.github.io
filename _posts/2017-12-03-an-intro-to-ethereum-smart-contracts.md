This article is probably a work in progress, but it is mostly a document for myself to keep
track of what I've learned and to remind myself of how to get started. In
this way, hopefully it will serve useful to others.

Without further ado, let's get into it.

### Getting Started

I found this [article](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05) and it had a couple suggestions that we'll be trying out. First is to use `testrpc`, or as renamed after being taken under the [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) banner, [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli). This will give you an environment to simulate and deploy your code to a test blockchain.

So installing both of these gets us started.
```
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli
```
