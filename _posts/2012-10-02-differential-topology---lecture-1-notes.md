This is the first of a series of lecture notes. I am going to try to
keep this up so that it forces me to review the notes I have taken in
lectures. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee these will be any good.

### Highlights of the Course

1. The first interesting theorem we will cover is Whitney's Theorem: Every $n$-dimensional
smooth manifold can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$.

  An embedding is an injective map with no self intersections.

2. Jordon Curve Theorem: Every simple closed curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$
splits $\mathbb{R}^2$ into connected components.

Jordon-Brower Theorem is the generalization that a simple closed $n-1$
dimensional manifold splits $\mathbb{R}^n$.

3. Euler Characteristic of a manifold $M$, $\chi(M)$ ($\chi = V - E + F). For example
$\chi(\mathbb{R}) = 1$, $\chi(S^2) = 2$, $\chi(T^2) = 0$.
