this is a small collection of research about the ellusive split
keyboard chair.

originally sighted in the microsoft azure commercial spotlighting
titanfall. it can be seen at about the 0:15 mark in [this youtube
video][1].

![screen cap from the youtube video][2]

there was someone asking about it [on twitter][3] and someone else
pointed them to [a blog article talking about this chair][4] that was
produced in the 90s and never again.

getting closer.
