<p>i am mostly writing this to document how i went about getting started with chef. in the past i've use puppet for configuration management across servers but because a coworker of mine uses chef on some of the servers, i thought i would, too.</p>

<p>so, mostly i've been sitting looking at how-to's and quickstart guides. nothing really caught my eye. the goal i thought i wanted was to create a chef-server from which everything would be pulled/pushed/etc acting as the main brains. but i will probably just use opscode's managed server which might make my life a lot easier. so let's get started.</p>

<h6>first steps</h6>

<p>following the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Quick+Start">quickstart guide</a>, i installed ruby on my arch linux laptop. this is the machine from which i'll be using to knife everything. after installing ruby, i made sure gem was updated by running <code>sudo gem update --system</code> and verifying the version. now i'm at the point where i want to figure out how to get chef to provision a new server on my ec2 stuff.</p>

<p>after moving the files required by chef into <code>.chef</code>, i installed knife-ec2 with <code>gem install knife-ec2</code> and added my aws credentials to <code>.chef/knife.rb</code> with the following information:
<pre>knife[:aws_access_key_id] = "..."
knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "........."</pre>
now <code>knife ec2 server list</code> shows me the instances i have running.</p>

<p>now i tested whether i could create a node and provision it with knife. i installed a couple cookbooks, chef-client and ubuntu, using the following command:
<pre>$ knife cookbook site install chef-client
$ knife cookbook site install ubuntu</pre>
i actually just ended up removing the entire cookbook directory and cloning the opscode repo of cookbooks and then uploaded those:
<pre>$ knife cookbook upload -a</pre>
and launched my instance with the following command:
<pre>$ knife ec2 server create "role[ubuntu],role[chef-client]" -I ami-1aad5273 -f t1.micro -S optimus-fs --ssh-user ubuntu --region us-east-1</pre>
i guess everything is working, but when i look at <code>knife show node</code>, i don't see the roles i created. but i think that was because i didn't actually create roles, so none of those recipes were run. there are a few recipes i do want to run, so we'll do that.</p>

<h6>figuring out cookbooks, recipes, and roles</h6>

<p>so now i have to figure out how to create a cookbook of recipes that i need to provision one of my servers. i have a few different types, but the 3 main servers i have are tomcat web apps, php web apps on apache, and mysql database servers.</p>

<p>there are also a couple of things i need on every machine i create and that is the ssh keys of the admins. this shouldn't be necessary since using ec2 my plan is to kill unruly instances, but it will be a good exercise in getting to know cookbooks and recipes.</p>

<p>so, there are a few packages i know i want to install, users, sudo, and ubuntu (because i'm using ubuntu, so why not?). these will comprise my 'base' role that every machine i have will run.</p>

<p>because the users cookbook gets its users from the <em>users</em> data bag, i created my user with this command <code>knife data bag create users ren</code> and pasted
<pre>{
  "id": "ren",
  "groups": "sysadmin",
  "ssh-keys": "ssh-rsa AA...RP ren@banana"
}</pre>
so far so good. <em>REMEMBER</em>, you need to upload your roles, so issue<pre>$ rake roles</pre> before trying to continue.</p>

<p>i started editing the role from knife, <code>knife role create base</code>. i added stuff like <code>"recipe[users]", "recipe[sudo]", "recipe[ubuntu]"</code> to the list. so now i'm retrying the command i used earlier to provision a server,
<pre>$ knife ec2 server create "role[base]" -I ami-1aad5273 -f t1.micro -S optimus-fs --ssh-user ubuntu --region us-east-1</pre>
and seeing how it goes.</p>

<p><em>to be continued...</em></p>
