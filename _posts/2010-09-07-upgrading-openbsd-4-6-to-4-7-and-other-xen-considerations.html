i did this from a preexisting installation of openbsd 4.6.

basically, all i did was downloaded the <code>bsd.rd</code> for openbsd 4.7 and copied it where the existing one was. i restarted the machine and at the <code>boot&gt;</code> prompt i entered
<pre>boot&gt; boot hd0a:bsd.rd</pre>

what remained was exactly like booting from a 4.7 install cd. i selected upgrade and now i have openbsd 4.7 up and running. yay!
