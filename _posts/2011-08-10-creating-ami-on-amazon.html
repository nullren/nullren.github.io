<p>this was <em>stupid</em> simple starting from an EBS boot volume.</p>

<h6>steps</h6>
<ol>
<li>launch an instance with an EBS boot volume. ubuntu has <a href="http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/release/">lots of images</a>.</li>
<li>make whatever changes you want to the volume. install, add, whatever services you need &mdash; configure them to start on boot (i just used rc.local).</li>
<li>stop the instance.</li>
<li>in the console, select "create image" from the instance actions pull-down menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>that's it. stupid simple.</p>
