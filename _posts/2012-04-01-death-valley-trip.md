this last weekend i went on a roadtrip and went car camping in death
valley. i should have taken many more pictures than i did, but these
three i liked.

i ended up seeing lots of really interesting places including the
racetrack playa, badwater basin, scotty's castle, and overlooking the
entire valley from 10,000 feet up at roger's peak. my camera was just
too bulky for me to carry around, but don't worry, i feel as though i am
in no risk of forgetting any of the things i saw there.
