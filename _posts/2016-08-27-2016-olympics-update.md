I just wanted to update the ongoings of the NBC olympic broadcast. Noteably, it
is awful. This year, nothing was live. I didn't even bother trying to watch any
of it online. I'm sure it was available in some capacity, instead I used my HD
antenna to watch the OTA broadcast.

Their broadcast was awful, it was full of commercials, which is bsaically to be
expected.

I the only things I think I saw were Phelps, Biles, and Bolt. There was really
nothing else I can remember from their broadcast. Mission accomplished?
