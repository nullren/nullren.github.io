i installed stunnel and put this in /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

<code>client = yes
libwrap = no

[someirc]
accept = 54321
connect = irc.someirc.net:6697
</code>

this is as simple as i could make it.

then i just started stunnel and BAM! i pointed my irc client to connect to localhost:54321 and it connected me thru ssl. pretty sweet. especially since that config doesn't require any certs or anything. double win!

<del>using arch, you have to remember your <code>/etc/hosts.allow</code> file. i added these:

<code>stunnel: ALL
networkirc: ALL</code></del>
